                <p class="bio-text">
                Well, hey there! Good to see you. Well I guess not <i>SEE</i> you but I'm glad you're here! Whether that be because you are a recruiter, friend, or just someone that is manually indexing github 
                    pages I welcome you! This website here is my repository of all the work on anything that I do. I realize that may be a lot but honestly Google Docs just wasn't doing it for me anymore. So with that, 
                    I'm gonna get right into my story since you were kind enough to ask.</p>
                        <p>As with most kids that grew up in the 2000s, my story starts with watching my brother play video games. Until about the age of six, whenever my brother wanted to hang out with me we would either go 
                    outside (parish the thought) or plop ourselves down in front of the TV and plug in a console. It wasn't until I was about 13 that I had my first experience with computers. I was gifted a Mac Mini from 
                    my dad and quickly went to work on the only thing that plagued my mind at the time, Minecraft.</p>
                        <p>Quickly, I learned to mod and change things within the game world. As I got older I realized that within these worlds I had a tendency to understand where the holes in the system were and how to 
                    manipulate them for my own advantage (stricly within the law of course). Can you see where the obsession started. The next step in my journey towards all things engineering wouldn't start until sophmore 
                    year of college.</p>
                        <p>I was in a rut, pursuing a career in Physical Therapy which I loved but was finding no success in. A hard conversation with my brother drove me to realize that my journey with PT was sadly at its' end. 
                    He suggested, with my knowledge of computers that I should switch majors to Computer Science. Oh boy what a mistake that was. The years following that were grueling. While I knew liked computers I found 
                    that I very much disliked all the software side of things. All I could see was "best practices" and good enough implementations everywhere I looked. This isn't what I wanted. I wanted a world to play in 
                    and display my creativity but as far as my eye could see was companies taking advantage of people and stealing their work for their own gain. As the deadline to graduate quickly approached I felt hopeless 
                    that I would find a career in Software Development that I would actually enjoy. Attending the University of Vermont, they really push the Software Developer path and I didn't know what other options I had. 
                    Until one day... I heard my roomate talking.</p>
                    
                        <p>He was in a class with a newer teacher that was teaching a class called Computer Networks. A class that entirely teaches how computers communicate with each other AND all the issues that come with that 
                    field. After going to see the professor myself I decided to take his classes. I LOVED them. I took Computer Networks and Computer Networking and Security and aced both of them. This is when my love for 
                    Computer Science truly showed. More specifically, my love for Cybersecurity.</p>
                        <p>I graduated from my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and immediately continued on in into a Graduate Program at UVM where I graduated with a degree in, you guessed it, Computer Science. 
                    I spent most of my off-time working on Cybersecurity stuff, learning the ropes of computer networking and all the holes that come with it. Creating a research project for one of my classes that involved 
                    creating a AI model that could detect phishing URL's with a ~90% accuracy. After graduating, I have taken on the role of a Cybersecurity Intern at Mascoma Bank in Vermont where I am still currently working 
                    and pursuing Penetration Testing as a full time job! My love for Computer Science has been a long, strange, and overall messy path. But I got here. And I'm here to stay.</p>
